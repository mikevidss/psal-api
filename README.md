# psal-api
The PSAL api provides data on high school sporting events in New York. The api, however, is only accessible on the website. 
The API requires cookies (which are created on the website) and can only be requested by the same site.
The python script in this repository creates a connection to the API that fools it into believing that it is a legitimate connection from the psal.org website.
